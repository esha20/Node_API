# Node_API

One shot at NODE and API learning. (Made routes and api to get better understanding of node and api.)
Tried to comment as much information as I thought would help. :)

Install all the dependencies :-
"npm i"

Change the mongoose uri with atlas link for your database.

To start the server, run in terminal :- 
"npm run dev"

****This repository has the basic skeleton for Fetch-all, fectch-by-id, update, delete, and add products in database APIs.One can refer to this for help****
